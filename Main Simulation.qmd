## Main Idea

Teams of various skills compete and their resulting elo's are calculated.
Teams will compete in various structures to see how competition structure influences the winner, and also how accurately elo can measure their true skill. 

```{r}
#| include: false
library(magrittr)
library(tidyverse)
library(elo)
```

```{r}
#Create the teams
teams <- c("dragons","whales","wolves","leaves")
skill <- c(2000,1800,1900,1500)
elos <- tibble(team=teams,skill=skill)
#create bracket
t1 <- expand_grid(home=teams,away=teams) |> filter(home!=away)
t1 %<>% mutate(result=match(home,away))
```
